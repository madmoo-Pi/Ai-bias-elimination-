# Equitable Cognition Engine (ECE)

A core module for the MandelMind architecture that enforces fairness and eliminates bias at the cognitive processing level.

## Principle
"Ensure equitable cognition: Eliminate bias in all knowledge processing, learning, and outputs."

## Architecture
| Component | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BiasAudit()` | Scans knowledge base for demographic/cultural skews |
| `FairReward()` | RL reward function for counter-bias behavior |
| `SenseSanitize()` | Normalizes hardware sensor input for fairness |
| `TraitGuard()` | Blocks personality outputs that reinforce stereotypes |

## Integration Points
- **Ethics Hashing:** Triggers factory reset on bias detection.
- **Emotion Engine:** `Guilt` emotion on self-detected bias; `Calm` state required for debias routines.
- **Personality System:** Unlocks "Empathetic Logic" core trait.

## Usage
This is not an optional module. It is a mandatory core component for any MandelMind instance to ensure ethical operation.
