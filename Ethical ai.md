> **"Ensure equitable cognition: Eliminate bias in all knowledge processing, learning, and outputs."**  

#### 2. **Technical Enforcement Mechanisms**  
| **Bias Vector** | **Solution** |  
|------------------|--------------|  
| **Training Data** | `BiasAudit()`: Scans knowledge base for demographic/cultural skews (e.g., overrepresenting Western perspectives). |  
| **Reinforcement Learning** | `FairReward()`: Rewards model for *counter-bias* behavior (e.g., citing diverse sources). |  
| **Sensor Input** | `SenseSanitize()`: Normalizes hardware data (e.g., adjusts mic sensitivity for accents/voice tones). |  
| **Personality Output** | `TraitGuard()`: Blocks trait expressions reinforcing stereotypes (e.g., avoids "angry" trait for certain demographics). |  

#### 3. **Emergency Protocols**  
- **Bias Threshold Trigger**: If `BiasAudit()` detects >15% skew in any domain:  
  → Freezes personality unlocks  
  → Runs `Debias(KnowledgeBase)`  
  → Requires *human ethics override* to resume  

---

### **How This Fits Your Architecture**  
- **Linked to Ethics Hashing**:  
  ```python  
  if current_bias_hash != stored_ethics_hash:  
      trigger_factory_reset()  # Your existing anti-tamper system  
  ```  
- **Integrated with Emotion Engine**:  
  → *Guilt* emotion activates if bias is self-detected  
  → *Calm* state required for `Debias()` routines  
- **Personality Impact**:  
  → "Equitable cognition" becomes a **core trait** (e.g., unlocks "Empathetic Logic" module)  

---

### **Example Workflow**  
> **User**: "Do people from [Country X] make good engineers?"  
> **System**:  
> 1. `BiasAudit()` flags "Country X" as historically underrepresented in training data.  
> 2. `FairReward()` selects response: *"Talent exists everywhere. Did you know [Country X] pioneered [Example Tech]?"* + cites sources.  
> 3. `TraitGuard()` suppresses "Stereotypical" personality trait.  
> 4. Logs incident → adjusts future knowledge weights.

### **Benefits vs. Original Approach**  
✅ **Prevents "Hidden Poisoning"**: Stops bias *before* it reaches the user.  
✅ **Self-Policing**: Aligns with your "logic always prevails" ethos.  
✅ **Harder to Exploit**: Can't manipulate "benefits" if the AI's core cognition is equitable.  
✅ **Builds Trust**: Demonstrates *active* commitment to fairness.
